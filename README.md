# Project: FaceGuard - Facial Recognition Attendance System
FaceMark is a Python-based facial recognition attendance system designed to automate the process of marking attendance in various settings such as classrooms, offices, and events. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and recognize faces, enabling seamless and efficient attendance management.

# Overview:
FaceGuard is a Python-based facial recognition attendance system designed to automate the attendance marking process. It uses computer vision techniques to detect and recognize faces, making attendance management efficient and convenient.

# Features:
Face Detection: Utilizes OpenCV and dlib libraries for accurate face detection.
Facial Recognition: Recognizes faces using pre-trained models for attendance marking.
Database Integration: Stores attendance records in a MySQL database for easy management.
Real-time Processing: Performs face recognition in real-time for quick and efficient attendance tracking.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction and monitoring.
# Installation:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FaceGuard.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up MySQL database and update credentials in config.py
Run the application: python faceguard.py
# Usage:
Start the application and select the mode (e.g., classroom, office).
Add faces of individuals for recognition (optional).
Begin the attendance session, and the system will automatically mark attendance based on recognized faces.
